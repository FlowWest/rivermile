\title{Get Nearest River Mile Point}
\usage{
get_nearest_river_mile_pt(river_mile_points, spatial_pt)
}
\arguments{
\item{river_mile_points}{An `sf` object containing river mile locations,
with a `geometry` column representing point geometries and a `river_mile` column.}

\item{spatial_pt}{An `sf` object representing a single point location (e.g., a sampling point).}
}
\value{
The river mile value from `river_mile_points` that is closest to `spatial_pt`.
If no match is found, returns `NA`.
}
\description{
Finds the nearest river mile for a given spatial point by computing the
shortest geodesic distance between the point and a set of river mile locations.
}
\details{
- Ensures that both `spatial_pt` and `river_mile_points` have a defined CRS (`EPSG:4326`).
- Transforms `spatial_pt` to match the CRS of `river_mile_points` if necessary.
- Computes distances using `st_distance()` and returns the nearest river mile.
