\title{Extract Simplified Waterbody Names}
\usage{
extract_waterbody_short(names)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{A character vector containing descriptive waterbody names, typically from site or logger metadata.}
}
\value{
A character vector of simplified waterbody names (e.g., `"Adobe Creek"`, `"Klamath River"`), with optional descriptors and noise removed.
}
\description{
Parses and simplifies waterbody names from a character vector by removing directional and structural descriptors to retain only the core `"River"` or `"Creek"` name.
}
\details{
This function is designed to reduce waterbody names to a consistent and minimal form by:
\itemize{
  \item Standardizing `"Rvr"` and `"r"` to `"River"`
  \item Removing prefixes such as `"Fork"`, `"Slough"`, `"Branch"`, `"Tributary"`, `"Side Channel"`, etc.
  \item Removing directional descriptors like `"Upper"`, `"Lower"`, `"North"`, `"East"`, etc.
  \item Extracting only names ending in `"Creek"` or `"River"`
  \item Stripping common suffix noise like `"at"` and `"HOBO"`
  \item Trimming whitespace from the final result
}

This is useful when comparing or filtering by standardized stream names across datasets.

  "Upper Adobe Creek at HOBO",
  "South Fork Rvr",
  "Side Channel Klamath River",
  "West Branch Willow Creek"

# Returns: "Adobe Creek", "South River", "Klamath River", "Willow Creek"
